Write a function that takes in a string and and returns the string with white space removed and all letters changed to lowercase . This is a common task when a variable, routeName, etc needs to be created from user input.

Can you solve without `regex` or `split(), join()` ?

Ex:
Input: Tg School
Output: tgschool

Input: favorite tree ever
Output: favoritetreeever

Input: one word
Output: oneword

**Hint:** You can use `toLowerCase()`
